# 🏙️ CityVista - A City Builder (Unity - Mobile Study)

A mobile-friendly **city-building game** made with **Unity**, where players expand their city by playing **cards** — each representing different buildings, upgrades, or effects.

* Unity's **UI system** and **mobile input**
* Managing **game state** with cards as core mechanics
* Optimizing performance for mobile platforms
* Scene management and lightweight asset handling

### Core Features:

* Card-based gameplay system: draw, place, and trigger actions
* Simple city simulation logic
